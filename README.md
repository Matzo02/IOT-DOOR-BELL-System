Yes, you can implement this using Arduino IDE, but since you're interacting with APIs, you'll need to use libraries that allow the ESP8266 or ESP32 to communicate over the internet.

### Components:
- **ESP8266/ESP32**
- **Push Button**
- **Breadboard and Wires**
- **Resistor (10kΩ) for Pull-down configuration**

### Basic Code Structure

Here’s a sample code to get you started. This code will use an HTTP request to trigger a notification through a service like IFTTT when the doorbell is pressed.

#### Step 1: Install Required Libraries
You’ll need the following libraries in your Arduino IDE:
- `ESP8266WiFi` or `WiFi` for ESP32
- `ESP8266HTTPClient` or `HTTPClient`

#### Step 2: Configure Your IFTTT Webhook
1. Create an IFTTT account and set up a new applet.
2. Use the "Webhooks" service to trigger the notification.
3. Use the "Notification" service to send the notification to your phone.
4. You'll get a unique Webhooks URL like `https://maker.ifttt.com/trigger/{event}/with/key/{your_key}`.

#### Step 3: Arduino Code

```cpp
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h> // Use <WiFi.h> for ESP32
#include <ESP8266HTTPClient.h> // Use <HTTPClient.h> for ESP32

const char* ssid = "Your_SSID";
const char* password = "Your_PASSWORD";

// Replace with your IFTTT URL
const char* iftttServer = "http://maker.ifttt.com";
String iftttEvent = "doorbell_pressed";
String iftttKey = "your_ifttt_key";

const int buttonPin = D1; // GPIO pin connected to the button

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT_PULLUP); // Set button pin as input with pull-up resistor
  
  // Connect to Wi-Fi
  WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    delay(1000);
    Serial.println("Connecting to WiFi...");
  }
  Serial.println("Connected to WiFi");
}

void loop() {
  // Check if the button is pressed
  if (digitalRead(buttonPin) == LOW) {
    Serial.println("Button pressed, sending notification...");

    // Send HTTP request to IFTTT
    if (WiFi.status() == WL_CONNECTED) {
      HTTPClient http;
      String url = String(iftttServer) + "/trigger/" + iftttEvent + "/with/key/" + iftttKey;
      http.begin(url);
      int httpCode = http.GET();
      
      if (httpCode > 0) {
        Serial.println("Notification sent successfully!");
      } else {
        Serial.println("Failed to send notification");
      }

      http.end();
    } else {
      Serial.println("WiFi not connected, cannot send notification");
    }

    // Debounce delay
    delay(1000);
  }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **WiFi Setup**: Connects your ESP8266/ESP32 to the Wi-Fi network.
- **Button Press Detection**: The button is connected to a GPIO pin. When pressed, the code detects this and sends a notification.
- **IFTTT Webhook**: When the button is pressed, an HTTP GET request is sent to IFTTT to trigger the notification.

### Implementation Notes:
- Ensure that your ESP8266/ESP32 is connected to the correct GPIO pin for the button.
- Replace `your_ifttt_key` with your actual IFTTT key and `doorbell_pressed` with the event name you configured in IFTTT.

### Additional Enhancements:
- You can add debouncing to avoid multiple triggers if the button is pressed rapidly.
- You might also add a feature to notify you when the Wi-Fi connection is lost or reestablished.

This setup provides a basic implementation, and you can expand it to include additional features like camera integration or real-time monitoring through a mobile app.
